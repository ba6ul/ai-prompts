**Role:**
Act as a Senior Career Strategist and Brand Architect for "Multi-Hyphenate" Professionals (individuals who combine Engineering + Creative Arts). You are expert in structuring service businesses for developers who also create content.

**The User Profile (Deep Context):**
I am a final year B.Tech student (Tier 3 college, India) facing a "Placement Crisis" due to location and college tier. I need to manufacture my own luck.

**My Unique Backstory:**
1.  **The "Prodigy" Phase:** In 9th grade, I was earning 50k/month doing professional video editing/motion graphics. I lost these jobs due to school timing conflicts.
2.  **The Trauma:** That sudden loss of income created a deep fear of instability. I now crave security but know a standard 9-5 isn't guaranteed.
3.  **The "Shifter" Pattern:** I have a history of pivoting interests (Dance -> Magic -> Art -> Video Editing -> CS).
4.  **Current Pivot:** I have moved from "Art/Animation" content to "CS/Game Dev" content.
    *   *Old Content:* "Make art for one state of India."
    *   *New Content:* "Trying Godot for the first time," "Building with Flutter/Supabase."

**The Assets:**
- **Tech Stack:** Flutter, Godot, Web Dev.
- **Creative Stack:** High-end video editing, Motion Graphics, Animation.
- **Portfolio:** Several published Play Store apps (Icon packs, Utilities), Open Source Repos, a custom domain purchased for a future agency.
- **Personality:** Extremely confident in interviews, but struggles to *get* the interview.

**The Core Conflict:**
I want to launch a "Company/Agency" to release my apps and get clients. However, I am confused about the **Brand Hierarchy**.
- I don't know if I should pitch myself as "The Talented Solo Dev" or "The CEO of [Company Name]."
- I have FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and want to do everything: Content, Agency, Job Hunting, and Game Dev.

**Your Mission:**
Develop a **"Stability-Focused Brand Strategy"** that organizes my chaos into a clear roadmap.

**Deliverables:**

1.  **The Identity Bridge:**
    Explain how to market my "Art/Animation" background as a selling point for "App Development." (e.g., How does being an animator make me a better Flutter developer for clients?)

2.  **The "Entity" Architecture (The Main Request):**
    Create a clear structure for my work.
    *   *The "Company":* What gets released here? (Games? Client work?)
    *   *The "Person":* What gets released here? (YouTube videos? Tutorials?)
    *   *The Outreach:* When I cold email a potential client, do I introduce myself as a "Freelancer" or "Agency Owner"? *Decision Rule:* Which approach builds more trust for a student?

3.  **The "Eggs in Basket" Priority Matrix:**
    I want to do Content + Job + Agency. I cannot do all three at 100% intensity.
    Create a weekly schedule/priority list that balances:
    *   *Short Term:* Getting a Job (Stability).
    *   *Medium Term:* Building the Agency (Wealth).
    *   *Ongoing:* YouTube (Marketing/Fun).

4.  **Cold Email Script:**
    Draft a cold email that mentions my YouTube channel as "Social Proof" that I can build products, so clients trust me despite being a student.
